Authentication
==============

The authentication service is a tool for managing all users on your system and what services these are able to access.

Users are grouped into Groups which are then granted Permissions, it is these Permissions which grant each user group access to the different services and functionality.

The authentication page will also display all users logged in and the service they last used.
